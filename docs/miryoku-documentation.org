Miryoku is an ergonomic, minimal, orthogonal, universal keyboard layout.  This
document describes the layout.  For implementations see

* Introduction

Not alphas, not physical, max ergo, min movement, no contortions


** General Principles

- Use layers instead of reaching.
- Use both hands instead of contortions.
- Use the home positions as much as possible.
- Make full use of the thumbs.
- Avoid unnecessary complication.


* Physical Layout



- 5 columns, 3 rows, 3 thumb keys, 2 hands.
- Can be used on almost any split or non-split ergo or ortho keyboard.
- Includes all keys found on a US layout TKL keyboard, plus media keys and mouse
  emulation.
- Home row is the middle row, home thumb key is the middle thumb key.
- Maximum 1-u movement from home position for fingers and thumbs, and only along
  one axis (except for the inner index finger column which is deprioritised
  compared with the home columns).

* Functional Layout

[[../data/layers/miryoku-kle-reference.png]]

- Dual-function modifiers on home row, mirrored on both hands.
- Dual-function layer change on thumbs.
- Layers are designed orthogonally with a single purpose per hand and are
  accessed by holding a thumb key on the opposite hand.
- All layers on the same hand are based on the same basic key arrangement.
- Holding layer change and modifiers on one hand combined with a single key
  press on the other hand can produce any combination of modifiers and single
  keys without any finger contortions.
- Single function mods are also defined on layers on the same hand as the layer
  change thumb key so layer change and mods can be held in any order or
  simultaneously without race conditions.
- As mods are only enabled on the opposite hand, auto-repeat is available on the
  home row on layers for use with cursor and mouse keys.
- Tap-hold auto-repeat is disabled to permit faster tap-hold switching on
  thumbs, but thumb tap keys are mirrored onto some layers for use with
  auto-repeat.  On other layers thumb keys are redefined with important
  functions for that layer.
- Auto Shift for numbers and symbols.


** Base Layer

[[../data/layers/miryoku-kle-base.png]]

The default layer is the base layer, and contains the alphas and most important
punctuation on the fingers and the most important _ keys on the thumbs.

The default base layer alpha layout is Colemak Mod-DH.  

  Thumb keys are backspace, enter, delete on
the right and space, tab, escape on the left.  Dot, comma and apostrophe are
included for prose, dot and slash for file and directory names.


** Single Hand Layers


*** Right Hand Layers


**** Navigation and Editing

  [[../data/layers/miryoku-kle-nav.png]]

  Primary right-hand layer (left home thumb) is navigation and editing.  Cursor
  keys are on the home position, line and page movement below, clipboard above,
  caps lock and insert on the inner column.  Thumb keys are duplicated from the
  base layer to avoid having to layer change mid edit and to enable auto-repeat.


**** Mouse Emulation

  [[../data/layers/miryoku-kle-mouse.png]]

  Secondary right-hand layer is mouse emulation.  Mouse movement mirrors cursor
  navigation on home and wheel mirrors line / page movement below.  Buttons are on
  the thumbs (L, M, R).  Mouse movement, click, and drag with modifiers can be
  performed from the home position.  Unused keys are available for other related
  functions.


**** Media

  [[../data/layers/miryoku-kle-media.png]]

  Tertiary right-hand layer is media control, with volume up / down and next /
  prev mirroring the navigation keys.  Pause, stop and mute are on thumbs.  RGB
  control is on the top row (combine with shift to invert).  Unused keys are
  available for other related functions.


*** Left Hand Layers 


**** Numbers and Symbols

  [[../data/layers/miryoku-kle-num.png]]

  Primary left-hand layer (right home thumb) is numbers and symbols.  Numbers
  are in the standard numpad locations with symbols in the remaining positions.
  Dot is duplicated from the base layer.


**** Shifted Numbers and Symbols

  [[../data/layers/miryoku-kle-sym.png]]


  Secondary left-hand layer has shifted symbols in the same locations to reduce
  chording when using mods with shifted symbols.  Open parenthesis is duplicated
  next to close parenthesis.


**** Function and System

  [[../data/layers/miryoku-kle-fun.png]]


  Tertiary left-hand layer has function keys mirroring the numbers on the primary
  layer with extras on the pinkie column, plus system keys on the inner column.
  App (menu) is on the tertiary thumb key and other thumb keys are duplicated from
  the base layer to enable auto-repeat.
